title: The 'run' Command
description: Running flows with various options
---

The `restflow run` command is used to execute your `.flow` files. You can specify one or more files or directories as arguments.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run a single flow file
restflow run my-test.flow

# Run multiple specific flow files
restflow run test1.flow test2.flow

# Run all flow files in a directory (and its subdirectories)
restflow run ./tests/
```

### Command Options

The `run` command has several options to customize its behavior.

#### `--env <path>` or `-e <path>`

Load environment variables from a specific file.

```bash
restflow run tests/ --env .env.staging
```

#### `--format <format>` or `-f <format>`

Specify the output format.
- `console` (default): Human-readable, colored output.
- `json`: Machine-readable JSON output.
- `summary`: A concise table of results.

```bash
restflow run tests/ --format json > results.json
```

#### `--timeout <ms>`

Set a timeout in milliseconds for each HTTP request. The default is typically 30 seconds (30000 ms).

```bash
# Set a 10-second timeout
restflow run tests/ --timeout 10000
```

#### `--show-body`

Include the request and response bodies in the output. This is very useful for debugging.

#### `--show-headers`

Include the request and response headers in the output.

#### `--verbose`

Enable verbose logging for more detailed output about the execution process.

### Combining Options

You can combine these options to suit your needs.

```bash
# Run tests against staging, with a 5s timeout, and show bodies and headers
restflow run tests/ --env .env.staging --timeout 5000 --show-body --show-headers
```
