The Restflow CLI is the primary way to execute your API tests. The base command is `restflow`.

You can get help at any time by running:
```bash
restflow --help
```

### Main Commands

Restflow has a few main commands for different tasks.

#### `restflow run`

This is the most important command. It is used to execute one or more `.flow` files.

```bash
# Run a single flow
restflow run path/to/your.flow

# Run all flows in a directory
restflow run path/to/your/flows/
```

This command has many options for controlling the execution, which are detailed on the `run` command page.

#### `restflow init`

The `init` command helps you set up a new Restflow project or add Restflow to an existing one. It can create a sample project structure with example flows and an environment file.

```bash
# Initialize a new Restflow project in the current directory
restflow init
```

This is a great way to get started quickly.

### Global Options

These options can be used with any command.

- `--help`: Show help information.
- `--version`: Show the installed version of Restflow.
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed logging, which can be useful for debugging.
