title: Flows and Steps
description: Understanding the basic structure of Restflow tests
---

In Restflow, your API tests are organized into **flows** and **steps**. This structure helps you create readable, maintainable, and powerful tests.

### Flows

A **flow** is a single `.flow` file that contains a sequence of steps. It represents a complete user journey or a set of related API tests. For example, a `login.flow` file could contain all the steps required to authenticate a user.

Flows are executed from top to bottom. You can run a single flow or multiple flows at once.

### Steps

A **step** is a single API request within a flow. Each step has a name, an HTTP request, and optional directives for assertions and variable capturing.

A step is defined using `###` followed by the step name.

Here is an example of a flow with two steps:

```flow
### Step 1: Get a post
GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1

> assert status == 200

### Step 2: Create a new post
POST https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "My new post",
  "body": "A great post"
}

> assert status == 201
```

In this example:
- The file itself represents the flow.
- "Get a post" is the first step.
- "Create a new post" is the second step.

Each step is independent by default, but you can use variables to pass data between steps, creating powerful testing workflows.
