title: Variables Overview
description: A brief introduction to variables in Restflow
---

Variables are a key feature of Restflow, allowing you to create dynamic and flexible API tests. You can use variables to pass data between steps, use environment-specific values, and generate random data.

### Variable Syntax

Variables in Restflow use the `{{variable_name}}` syntax. When a flow is executed, Restflow replaces these placeholders with their corresponding values.

```flow
### Get user profile
GET https://api.example.com/users/{{userId}}
Authorization: Bearer {{auth_token}}
```

### Types of Variables

Restflow supports several types of variables:

- **Environment Variables**: Loaded from `.env` files. Useful for storing environment-specific data like API keys and base URLs.
- **Captured Variables**: Extracted from the response of a previous step using the `capture` directive. This is how you chain requests together.
- **Built-in Variables**: Provided by Restflow for generating dynamic data like `{{uuid}}`, `{{timestamp}}`, and `{{randomString}}`.
- **CLI Variables**: Passed from the command line when running a flow.

### A Simple Workflow

Here's an example of how variables connect steps in a workflow:

```flow
### 1. Login and get a token
POST https://api.example.com/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "{{test_user}}",
  "password": "{{test_password}}"
}

> capture auth_token = body.token

### 2. Use the token to access a protected resource
GET https://api.example.com/profile
Authorization: Bearer {{auth_token}}

> assert status == 200
```

In this example:
1. `{{test_user}}` and `{{test_password}}` are likely defined in an environment file.
2. The `capture` directive saves the `token` from the login response into the `auth_token` variable.
3. The `auth_token` variable is then used in the `Authorization` header of the next request.

This is just a brief overview. The "Variables & Environment" section provides more in-depth information on each variable type.
