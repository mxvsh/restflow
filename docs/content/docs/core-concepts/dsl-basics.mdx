description: Introduction to the .flow file syntax
---

The Restflow DSL (Domain-Specific Language) is designed to be simple, readable, and easy to write. All tests are written in `.flow` files using a plain text format.

### Basic Structure

A `.flow` file is composed of one or more steps. Each step has the following structure:

```
### Step Name
HTTP_METHOD URL
Header-Name: Header-Value

Request Body

> directive
```

- **Step Name**: A descriptive name for your step, starting with `###`.
- **HTTP Method and URL**: The HTTP method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`) and the endpoint URL.
- **Headers**: Optional HTTP headers, one per line.
- **Request Body**: The body of the request, separated from the headers by a blank line.
- **Directives**: Actions to perform after the request, such as assertions or capturing variables. Each directive starts with `>`.

### Example

Here's a complete example of a `.flow` file with a single step:

```flow
### Create a new user
POST https://api.example.com/users
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{api_key}}

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}

> assert status == 201
> assert body.id != null
> capture userId = body.id
```

This example demonstrates all the basic components of the DSL in action. As you can see, it's designed to be self-documenting and easy to understand at a glance.
