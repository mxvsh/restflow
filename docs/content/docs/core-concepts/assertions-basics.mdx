Assertions are used to verify that your API is behaving as expected. In Restflow, you use the `assert` directive to check the status code, headers, and body of a response.

### The `assert` Directive

The `assert` directive has the following structure:

`> assert <source> <operator> <value>`

- **source**: The part of the response to check (e.g., `status`, `body.id`, `headers["content-type"]`).
- **operator**: The comparison to perform (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `>`, `contains`).
- **value**: The expected value.

If an assertion fails, the step is marked as failed, and the execution of the flow may stop depending on your configuration.

### Common Assertions

Here are some of the most common assertions you'll use:

#### Checking the Status Code

This is the most fundamental assertion. You should almost always check the status code.

```flow
### Get a resource
GET https://api.example.com/items/1

> assert status == 200
```

#### Checking the Response Body

You can use JSONPath to access values in a JSON response body.

```flow
### Get a user
GET https://api.example.com/users/123

> assert body.id == 123
> assert body.name == "John Doe"
> assert body.address.city == "New York"
```

#### Checking for Existence

You can check if a field exists in the response.

```flow
> assert body.id != null
```

#### Checking Array Length

```flow
> assert body.items.length > 0
```

#### Checking Headers

```flow
> assert headers["content-type"] contains "application/json"
```

These are just the basics. The "DSL Reference" section has a complete guide to all the available assertion operators and advanced techniques.
