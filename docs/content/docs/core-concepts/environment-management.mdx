Real-world API testing requires running the same tests against different environments, such as development, staging, and production. Restflow makes this easy with its support for `.env` files.

### What is an `.env` file?

An `.env` file is a simple text file that contains key-value pairs for your environment-specific variables.

Here is an example `.env` file:

```env
# .env.staging
BASE_URL=https://staging.api.example.com
API_KEY=staging-secret-key
TEST_USER=staging_user
```

### Using Environment Variables

You can use the variables from your `.env` file in your flows using the `{{variable_name}}` syntax.

```flow
### Get data from a protected endpoint
GET {{BASE_URL}}/data
Api-Key: {{API_KEY}}

> assert status == 200
```

### Running with an Environment

To run your flows with a specific environment file, use the `--env` flag on the command line:

```bash
restflow run my-flow.flow --env .env.staging
```

When you run this command, Restflow will load the variables from `.env.staging` and make them available in your flow.

This allows you to keep your `.flow` files clean and free of environment-specific details. You can have multiple `.env` files for your different environments:
- `.env.dev`
- `.env.staging`
- `.env.prod`

And switch between them easily using the `--env` flag. This is a powerful feature for creating portable and maintainable API tests.
