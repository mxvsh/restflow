title: Variable Types
description: Understanding the different types of variables in Restflow
---

Restflow has a powerful variable system with several types of variables. Understanding each type will help you write more dynamic and maintainable tests.

### Variable Resolution Priority

When a variable is used, Restflow searches for its value in the following order of priority (from highest to lowest):

1.  **CLI Variables**: Passed via the command line.
2.  **Captured Variables**: Extracted from a previous step's response.
3.  **Environment Variables**: Loaded from `.env` files.
4.  **Built-in Variables**: Provided by Restflow for dynamic data generation.

This means that a CLI variable will override an environment variable with the same name.

### 1. CLI Variables

You can pass variables directly from the command line when you run a flow. This is useful for overriding default values or for use in CI/CD pipelines.

*(Note: The exact syntax for passing CLI variables will be covered in the CLI Reference section.)*

### 2. Captured Variables

These variables are created using the `capture` directive. They allow you to extract a value from an HTTP response and use it in subsequent requests. This is the primary way to chain requests together.

```flow
### Login and capture token
POST /login
...
> capture auth_token = body.token

### Use the captured token
GET /profile
Authorization: Bearer {{auth_token}}
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Environment variables are loaded from `.env` files and are typically used for environment-specific configuration like API keys, base URLs, or test user credentials.

```dotenv
# .env.staging
BASE_URL=https://staging.api.example.com
API_KEY=my-secret-key
```

### 4. Built-in Variables

Restflow provides a set of built-in variables for generating common types of dynamic data.

- `{{uuid}}`: A version 4 UUID.
- `{{timestamp}}`: A Unix timestamp.
- `{{randomString}}`: A random alphanumeric string.
- `{{randomNumber}}`: A random number.

Each time a built-in variable is used, it generates a new, unique value.
