Environment files (or `.env` files) are the standard way to manage environment-specific configuration in Restflow. They allow you to keep your `.flow` files clean and portable across different environments like development, staging, and production.

### File Format

An `.env` file is a simple text file with `KEY=VALUE` pairs.

```env
# This is a comment
BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
API_KEY=your-secret-api-key
TEST_USER_EMAIL=test@example.com
```

- Comments start with `#`.
- Keys are typically uppercase, but this is not required.
- Values are everything after the `=`. Do not use quotes unless they are part of the value.

### Naming Conventions

While you can name your environment files anything, a common convention is to use `.env.<environment_name>`.

- `.env.development`
- `.env.staging`
- `.env.production`
- `.env.local` (for local overrides)

### Loading an Environment File

Use the `--env` or `-e` flag when running Restflow to specify which environment file to load.

```bash
# Run tests against the staging environment
restflow run tests/ --env .env.staging

# Run tests against the production environment
restflow run tests/ --env .env.production
```

If you don't specify an `--env` flag, Restflow will automatically look for a file named `.env` in the current directory.

### Best Practices

1.  **Never commit secrets**: Add your `.env` files with sensitive information (like API keys and passwords) to your `.gitignore` file.
2.  **Create a template file**: Create an example file like `.env.example` with all the required keys but with placeholder values. Commit this file to your repository so other developers know what variables are needed.
3.  **Use `BASE_URL`**: Define a `BASE_URL` in your environment files and use relative paths in your flows. This makes your tests highly portable.
4.  **Keep it flat for now**: While Restflow supports advanced features like variable chaining in `.env` files, it's best to start with a simple, flat list of key-value pairs.
